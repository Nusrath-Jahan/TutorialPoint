        JavaScript is an object-based scripting language which is lightweight and cross-platform.

JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated language. The JavaScript Translator 
(embedded in the browser) is responsible for translating the JavaScript code for the web browser.

          <h2><u>What is JavaScript</u></h2>
        
       
        <p>JavaScript (js) is a 
            light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several
            websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming 
            language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document.
            It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. 
            Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, 
            users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. 
            The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.</p>

         <h2><u>Why Learn JavaScript ?</u></h2>
         <p>JavaScript (js) is a 
            light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several
            websites for scripting the webpages. </p>
     
            <p> Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. 
            The name was suggested and provided in the times when Java was gaining popularity in the market.
            In addition to web browsers,
            databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language.
