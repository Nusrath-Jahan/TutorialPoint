         <h2><u>JavaScript Comment</u></h2>
         
        <br>
        The JavaScript comments are meaningful way to deliver message. 
        It is used to add information about the code, warnings or suggestions 
        so that end user can easily interpret the code.
        <br>
        <br>
        The JavaScript comment is ignored by the JavaScript engine i.e. embedded in the browser.
        <br>
        <h5> Advantages of JavaScript comments</h5>
        1. To make code easy to understand It can be used to elaborate the code 
        so that end user can easily understand the code.
       2.To avoid the unnecessary code It can also be used to avoid the code being executed. 
       Sometimes, we add the code to perform some action. But after sometime, there may be need 
       to disable the code. In such case, it is better to use comments.

          <h2><u>Types of JavaScript Comments</u></h2>
        
       
        <p>JavaScript (js) is a 
            light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several
            websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming 
            language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document.
            It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. 
            Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, 
            users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. 
            The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.</p>
        
        <br>
       
        JavaScript is an object-based scripting language which is lightweight and cross-platform.

JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated language. The JavaScript Translator 
(embedded in the browser) is responsible for translating the JavaScript code for the web browser.
        <br>
        <br>
         <h2><u>JavaScript Single line Comment</u></h2>
         <p>It is represented by double forward slashes . It can be used before and after the statement.

              Let?s see the example of single-line comment i.e. added before the statement. </p>
     
            <p> Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. 
            The name was suggested and provided in the times when Java was gaining popularity in the market.
            In addition to web browsers,
            databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language.
